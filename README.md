# CodeGenAI Model Card

## Model Description

**Architecture:** Describe the model architecture (e.g., Transformer-based).

**Training Data:** Briefly describe the dataset used for training.

**Objective:** Explain the primary purpose of the model.

## Intended Use

- **Primary Use Case:** Describe the main application(s) of the model.
- **Out-of-Scope Use Cases:** Highlight scenarios where the model should not be applied.

## Performance

Provide metrics that evaluate the model's performance.

## Limitations

Discuss any known limitations or biases in the model.

## Ethical Considerations

Address potential ethical implications of using the model.

## How to Use

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("canstralian/CodeGenAI")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("canstralian/CodeGenAI")

input_text = "Your input text here"
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)
```
